## Connect AI Tools to Adobe Experience Manager

Transform how you interact with Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS) by connecting your favorite AI tools through Model Context Protocol (MCP). These servers provide a secure, high-performance bridge between AI assistants and your AEM instance.

### Two Powerful Servers

🔍 **Read Server**: Safely explore and analyze your AEM content with 50+ read-only operations  
✏️ **Write Server**: Manage and automate content creation with 40+ write operations

Perfect for content teams, developers, and AI-powered workflows that need seamless AEM integration.

```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ 
- npm 8+
- Docker (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Build packages
npm run build

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

### Environment Configuration

The servers automatically load configuration from a `.env` file. This keeps your credentials secure and separate from your MCP configuration.

**Required Steps:**
1. Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Edit `.env` with your AEMaaCS credentials
3. The MCP servers will automatically use these settings

**Key Configuration Options:**
- `AEM_HOST`: Your AEMaaCS instance URL (e.g., `https://your-instance.adobeaemcloud.com`)
- `AEM_AUTH_TYPE`: Authentication method (`oauth` for OAuth 2.0 Server-to-Server)
- `AEM_CLIENT_ID` & `AEM_CLIENT_SECRET`: OAuth 2.0 credentials
- `API_KEY`: Secure key for write operations

## Architecture

### Shared Package (`@aemaacs-mcp/shared`)

Common utilities and types used by both servers:

- **Types**: AEM and MCP protocol interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Structured error management with retry logic
- **Validation**: Input sanitization and security validation
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management
- **Logging**: Structured logging with audit capabilities

### Read Server (`@aemaacs-mcp/read-server`)

Provides safe, read-only access to AEMaaCS:

- Package information and status
- Content discovery and search
- Asset metadata and references
- User and group information
- Workflow and replication status
- System health and monitoring

### Write Server (`@aemaacs-mcp/write-server`)

Enables content management operations:

- Package creation, installation, and management
- Page and component operations
- Content publishing and replication
- User and group administration
- Asset upload and processing
- Workflow triggering and management

## Protocol Support

Both servers support dual interfaces:

1. **HTTP REST API**: JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant endpoints
2. **STDIO MCP Protocol**: Direct integration with AI tools and IDEs

## Security Features

docker-compose down
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing:

- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests with mock AEM responses
- Security and validation testing
- Performance and load testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage

```

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflow includes:

- Automated testing on multiple Node.js versions
- Code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier)
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Docker image building and publishing
- Integration testing with services

## Quick Start

### Get Started in 3 Steps

1. **Clone and Install**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd aemaacs-mcp-servers
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Your AEM Connection**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your AEMaaCS credentials
   # See "Getting Your AEM Credentials" section below
   ```

3. **Build the Servers**:
   ```bash
   npm run build --workspaces
   ```

4. **Start the Servers**:
   ```bash
   # Start read server (STDIO mode for MCP)
   node packages/read-server/dist/index.js --stdio
   
   # Start write server (STDIO mode for MCP)
   node packages/write-server/dist/index.js --stdio
   
   # Or start in HTTP mode for REST API access
   node packages/read-server/dist/index.js --http
   node packages/write-server/dist/index.js --http
   ```

5. **Test Your Connection** (HTTP mode):
   ```bash
   # Test read server
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   
   # Test write server (requires API key)
   curl -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" http://localhost:3002/health
   ```

## MCP Integration

### Step 1: Configure Your AEM Connection

First, create a `.env` file in your project root with your AEMaaCS credentials:

```bash
# AEM Connection (Required)
AEM_HOST=https://your-instance.adobeaemcloud.com
AEM_AUTH_TYPE=oauth
AEM_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
AEM_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

# Server Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Security (for write server)
API_KEY=your-secure-api-key
```

### Step 2: Configure Your MCP Client

#### Cursor MCP Configuration

Add this configuration to your **Cursor Settings > Features > Model Context Protocol**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aemaacs-read-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["packages/read-server/dist/index.js", "--stdio"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/aemaacs-mcp-server"
    },
    "aemaacs-write-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["packages/write-server/dist/index.js", "--stdio"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/aemaacs-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Replace the `cwd` path with your actual project directory path. The servers will automatically load configuration from your `.env` file.

#### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aemaacs-read": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["packages/read-server/dist/index.js", "--stdio"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/aemaacs-mcp-server"
    },
    "aemaacs-write": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["packages/write-server/dist/index.js", "--stdio"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/aemaacs-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

### Getting Your AEM Credentials

For detailed authentication setup, see **[Authentication Guide](docs/AUTHENTICATION.md)**.

**Quick Start Options:**

1. **OAuth 2.0 Server-to-Server** (Recommended for Production):
   - Go to [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console/)
   - Create a project and add AEM API
   - Generate OAuth 2.0 credentials
   - Copy Client ID and Client Secret to `.env`

2. **Token Authentication** (For Development):
   - Set `AEM_AUTH_TYPE=token` in your `.env` file
   - Set `AEM_ACCESS_TOKEN` to your development or session token
   - See [Authentication Guide](docs/AUTHENTICATION.md) for obtaining tokens

### Why Use .env File Configuration?

✅ **Security**: Keep sensitive credentials out of your MCP configuration files  
✅ **Simplicity**: No need to duplicate environment variables in multiple places  
✅ **Flexibility**: Easy to change configuration without modifying MCP settings  
✅ **Best Practice**: Standard approach for managing environment-specific settings  
✅ **Version Control Safe**: `.env` files are typically ignored by Git
